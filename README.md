# Criticisms of Web3

The purpose of this document is create a list of common **criticisms** of Web 3 and **counter-arguments** for each. Every counter-argument must have a **valid source**. Anyone can contribute to this doc with new criticims or new counter-arguments.

## Proof-of-Work wastes a lot of energy

#### Counter-argument 1:
**Bitcoin uses energy that otherwise would go to waste** [[1]](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/19/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption/)
- Sichuan has a massive overbuild of hydroelectric power in the last decade. Sichuan’s hydro capacity is 2x what its power grid can support, leading to lots of  waste. This otherwise-wasted energy has been put to use mining Bitcoin.
- There is historical precedent for this phenomenon. Before Bitcoin, aluminum served this purpose. To produce aluminum, it requires smelting bauxite ore. Because Iceland boasts cheap and abundant energy, smelting bauxite was a natural move. The ore was shipped from Australia or China, smelted in Iceland and shipped back to places like China for construction.

#### Counter-argument 2:
**Bitcoin mining is a net benefit to the energy sector** [[2]](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/11/bitcoin-mining-is-reshaping-the-energy-sector-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it/)
- TODO

#### Counter-argument 3:
**We are 88% done with the Bitcoin mining process** [[3]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-09/what-people-get-wrong-about-bitcoin-s-climate-footprint-nic-carter-video)
- Miners spend a lot of energy because a majority of their revenue today comes from new Bitcoin issuance. Therefore, the benefit of mining Bitcoin outweighs the cost.
- But in the future, this will change. Once all coins are issues, most of the revenue for miners will come from transaction fees only. This will lead to lower miner revenue and hence less energy expenditure.

#### Counter-argument 4:
**Bitcoin’s energy consumption is more efficient than gold and traditional banks** [[4]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/bitcoin-myths/)
- Traditional banking emits 1,368 Megatonnes (Mtoe) of carbon per year. Gold mining emits 144 Mtoe. Bitcoin emits 61 million Mtoe.

#### Counter-argument 5:
**Ethereum and many other blockchains (e.g. Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos, Terra, Binance Smart Chain, etc) do not use Proof-of-Work.**
- Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm will use at least ~99.95% less energy post merge and is expected to consume ~ 2.62 megawatt (around 2100 American homes).  [[5]](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/)
