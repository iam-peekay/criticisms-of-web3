# Criticisms of Web3

The purpose of this document is create a list of common **criticisms** of Web 3 and **counter-arguments** for each. Every counter-argument must have a **valid source**. Anyone can contribute to this doc with new criticims or new counter-arguments.

## Proof-of-Work wastes a lot of energy

### Counter-arguments

✔️ **Bitcoin uses energy that otherwise would go to waste** [[1]](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/19/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption/)
- Sichuan has a massive overbuild of hydroelectric power in the last decade. Sichuan’s hydro capacity is 2x what its power grid can support, leading to lots of  waste. This otherwise-wasted energy has been put to use mining Bitcoin.
- There is historical precedent for this phenomenon. Before Bitcoin, aluminum served this purpose. To produce aluminum, it requires smelting bauxite ore. Because Iceland boasts cheap and abundant energy, smelting bauxite was a natural move. The ore was shipped from Australia or China, smelted in Iceland and shipped back to places like China for construction.

✔️ **Bitcoin mining is a net benefit to the energy sector** [[2]](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/11/bitcoin-mining-is-reshaping-the-energy-sector-and-no-one-is-talking-about-it/)
 - The age of the hardware determines the type of energy that is used. Older ASICs units use more intermittent renewables because the costs of running the hardware are lower.
- Bitcoin miners can buy energy when energy is abundant and draw from the grid the rest of the time. This allows miners to monetize a renewable asset that would otherwise be wasted, while still maintaining generally high uptime. 
- Miners are signing deals with nuclear power plants [[3]](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/talen-energy-corporation-announces-zero-carbon-bitcoin-mining-joint-venture-with-terawulf-inc-301347297.html)
- Bitcoin miners are mining with waste methane which would otherwise be flared. This reduces emissions compared to the gas being flared.
- Bitcoin miners are ideal candidates for  “demand response” programs because they can deal with power outages without suffering adverse impacts to their business (unlike hospitals, factories, etc)
- Bitcoin miners can serve as a source of “controllable load”, where they can dial up and down their energy consumption to a level the grid operator demands so that  fossil-fuel plants don't need to used as much, resulting in lower overall carbon emissions.

✔️ **We are 88% done with the Bitcoin mining process** [[3]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-02-09/what-people-get-wrong-about-bitcoin-s-climate-footprint-nic-carter-video)
- Miners spend a lot of energy because a majority of their revenue today comes from new Bitcoin issuance. Therefore, the benefit of mining Bitcoin outweighs the cost.
- But in the future, this will change. Once all coins are issues, most of the revenue for miners will come from transaction fees only. This will lead to lower miner revenue and hence less energy expenditure.

✔️ **Bitcoin’s energy consumption is more efficient than gold and traditional banks** [[4]](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/bitcoin-myths/)
- Traditional banking emits 1,368 Megatonnes (Mtoe) of carbon per year. Gold mining emits 144 Mtoe. Bitcoin emits 61 million Mtoe.

✔️ **Ethereum and many other blockchains (e.g. Avalanche, Solana, Cosmos, Terra, etc) do not use Proof-of-Work.**
- Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm will use at least ~99.95% less energy post merge and is expected to consume ~ 2.62 megawatt (around 2100 American homes).  [[5]](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/)

## Web 3 has a lot of centralized services (e.g. OpenSea)

### Counter-arguments

✔️ **Web3 network effects accrue as public goods on the blockchain, not with centralized services** [[6]](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1485303906154467330?s=20&t=oqmI1N8DGVSmorokx31R9Q)
- OpenSea and other "centralized" Web 3 services don’t own the goods. Users own them on the blockchain and have full control over them.
- Users can easily switch services if those services start charging too much, inserting ads and algorithmic feeds, throttling their traffic, or mistreating them in other ways.[[7]](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1479920751650111491?s=20&t=oqmI1N8DGVSmorokx31R9Q)
- There will be centralized services in Web 3, but the switching costs on Web 3 are much lower than Web 2 (e.g. 2% on OpenSea vs. 30% on Apple App store). [[8]](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1479920756251234304?s=20&t=oqmI1N8DGVSmorokx31R9Q)
- By making data portable across centralized and decentralized services, Web 3 gives user more freedom and agency.

✔️ **Decentralized alternatives to platforms like OpenSea are being created** [[9]](https://looksrare.org/)


## Most people don’t want to own their keys

### Counter-arguments

✔️ **TODO** [[10]](TODO)
- TODO
